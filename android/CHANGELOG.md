# Changelog — Tanoshi for Android

All notable changes to the standalone Android app in `android/`. The app is
versioned independently of the upstream Tanoshi server it bundles (currently
Tanoshi **0.40.0**) and is released as GitHub releases tagged **`android-vX.Y.Z`**
(for example `android-v0.2.0`). The Termux package in the repository root has
its own `PACKAGE_TAG` and `v*` release tags.

Versioning: local/Gradle builds default to the version in
`android/app/build.gradle.kts`. CI derives `versionName` from the
`android-vX.Y.Z` tag and sets
`versionCode = major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch`, passing both to Gradle
with `-PappVersionName` / `-PappVersionCode`.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- **In-app updates** (`Settings → Updates`): checks this repository's public
  GitHub releases (unauthenticated, only non-draft/non-prerelease `android-v*`
  tags), compares the version numerically with the installed app, downloads
  the release APK with a progress indicator (SHA-256 verified when the GitHub
  release asset exposes a digest) and installs it through the system
  `PackageInstaller`. Requires network, the "Install unknown apps" permission
  for Tanoshi, and the user's confirmation in the system install prompt.
- **Selectable app themes** (`Settings → Appearance`): Dark (default), Light,
  Nord and Catppuccin Material 3 colour schemes. The choice applies
  immediately, is persisted (`AppSettings.themeId`) and also switches the
  system-bar icon contrast. It affects the app UI only — the embedded Tanoshi
  web UI keeps its own theme.
- `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission for the updater.

### Changed

- **Embedded web UI rebuilt with catalogue infinite scroll.** The vendored
  `android/native/web-dist/` is now the package-3 web UI built with
  `patches/tanoshi-infinite-scroll.patch`; `libtanoshi.so` was rebuilt with it.
  The catalogue now loads the next page automatically when an invisible
  sentinel below the grid (`catalogue-scroll-sentinel`) approaches the
  viewport; **Load More** stays as a manual fallback and becomes *No more
  results* when a source runs out of pages. The web UI is embedded in the
  server binary, so web-UI behaviour changes require rebuilding
  `libtanoshi.so`, not the Android app.
- **Stable sideload signing.** All releases (CI and local) are now signed with
  the committed key `android/keystore/tanoshi-signing.jks` (alias `tanoshi`)
  so the in-app updater can install a newer release over the existing app.
  The `debug` and `release` build types both use this key when the file is
  present, and fall back to the local Android debug keystore otherwise. See
  `android/keystore/README.md`.
- **Version/CI:** the app is 0.2.0 (`versionCode` 2 in the Gradle default;
  `android-v0.2.0` tags produce `versionCode` 200). CI computes both from the
  tag, and only `android-v*` tags trigger the workflow — plain `v*` Termux
  package tags are ignored.

### Upgrade note

**Users of 0.1.0 must uninstall it once before installing 0.2.0.** The 0.1.0
APK was signed with an ephemeral CI debug key, so Android refuses to install
0.2.0 over it. Uninstalling deletes the app's private data (library, accounts,
downloads); copy the `files/tanoshi/` directory out first if you need it.
This is a one-time step: every later release shares the committed signing key
and updates in place.

## 0.1.0

First standalone Android release (no Termux):

- Tanoshi 0.40.0 server (`libtanoshi.so`) and the nine extensions built for
  `aarch64-linux-android`, executed from `nativeLibraryDir`.
- Minimal `libarchive` 3.8.11 (zlib linked statically).
- Foreground `specialUse` service with wake lock, notifications and start/stop
  control; server data under `filesDir/tanoshi/` (`TANOSHI_HOME`).
- Compose UI: server dashboard, live log viewer, embedded WebView and browser
  hand-off, port / LAN exposure / `config.yml` editing, notification and
  battery-optimisation settings.
- First-run administrator creation through the server's GraphQL `register`
  mutation (no baked-in credentials).
- Debug-signed, arm64-v8a-only APK built by GitHub Actions on pushes, pull
  requests and `android-v*` tags.
